        <p> My name is Will Burbine. I am a freshman at the University of Rhode Island and I am currently undecided but I am leaning <br>
        towards majoring in computer science.
        I was originly born in connecticut but my family moved to Rhode Island in 2006 and <br>
        I have lived there ever since. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The things I enjoy to do on my free time is playing golf,hanging out with friends, and playing video games. I played for the <br>
        golf team for junior and senior year of high school and I hope to posibly join the URI team when ever I can. 
       </p>
