   <h1> About me </h1>
        <h2> My name is Will Burbine. I am a freshman at the University of Rhode Island and I am currently undecided but I am leaning towards majoring in computer science.
        I was originly born in connecticut but my family moved to Rhode Island in 2006 and I have lived there ever since. The things I enjoy to do on my free time is playing golf,
        hanging out with friends, and playing video games. I played for the golf team for junior and senior year of high school and I hope to posibly join the URI team when ever 
        I can. </h2>
